# AoC24
Advent of Code 2024!

## Day 1
As expect, this was easy and straight forward. I have realized I won't be code golfing as aggresively this year.

## Day 2
Pretty fun! The second part took me a little bit to think about and I am sure there are more performant solutions, but it lead to me to the correct answer none the less. 

## Day 3
Knew this was going to be a regex challenge and the second was brutal. Spent more time on it than I care to admin. In the end I decided to just manipulate the string as much as possible and it finally worked out.

## Day 4
Am I proud of this solution? Not really. Am I proud that I solved today? Heck yeah. I don't deal with matricies except when I do AoC. The first part took me a while, but that get_neighbors() function I wrote made the second part of the challenge pretty easy.

I learned about how to calcular colinearlity which was pretty neat.
